The orders table would have columns such as order ID, customer name, order date, and total price.
The order ID column would be the primary key for the orders table.

The products table would have columns such as product ID, product name, description, and price.
The product ID column would be the primary key for the products table.

To link the products to the orders, you could create a third table called order_items,
which would have columns such as order ID, product ID, quantity, and price.
This table would have foreign keys referencing the order ID and product ID columns from the orders and products tables respectively.
